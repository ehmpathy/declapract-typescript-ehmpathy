These packages should not be ignored in depcheck - they are either deprecated or have better alternatives:

- date-fns: use luxon instead
- procedure-fns: deprecated
- ts-node: use tsx instead
- ts-jest: use @swc/jest instead
- core-js: no longer needed with modern node
- babel-jest: use @swc/jest instead
