wish we could replace the googleapis/release-please-action with a simpler action constrained to our opinonated flow

also, one which we didn't have to wrap with updates on messages
also, one that runs rapidly, instead of taking 30sec

the main behaviors we require to maintain is
1. on any merge to main
   1. if its a `release` commit, cut a tag for it
   2. if its any other commit,
      1. upsert a release pr for it
      2. upsert =
         1. latestCommitHash = getLatestCommitHashFromMainBranchNow({ }) // should match the event that triggered the workflow
         2. found = getGithubPr({ where: { status: 'OPEN', tags: { purpose: 'release' } }})
         3. if (found && found.tags.uptilCommit === latestCommitHash) return found; // if the pr already coveres everything up till now, we're good! exit immediately
         4. desiredReleaseTag = computeNextSemverSinceLastTag({ }) // leverage commitlint + conventional commit
         5. desiredReleaseLog = computeNextChangelogSinceLastTag({ }) // just list the commit messages in sequence, w/ github links preserved, and dates of commit (see changelog.md)
         6. if (!found) return setGithubPr.create({ status: 'OPEN', title: getTitleFromTag(desiredReleaseTag), description: getDescFromLog(desiredReleaseLog), tags: { purpose: 'release', uptilCommit: $latestCommitHash, releaseTag: desiredReleaseTag })
         7. if (found) return setGithubPr.update({ for: found, with: { title: }})
         8. throw new UnexpectedCodePathError('should have returned by now')

```

should consider all of the edge cases that https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action/v3.7.6

has already covered today

except, narrow them down to only the ones that apply to our very narrow and opinionated release flow


---

why do we want to do this?
1. they keep breaking their contract; the maintenance cost of using their solution is too high && its a critical path dependency
2. they made such an unfriendly solution to aesthetics and speed; near-zero useful low-effort customization

plus, google hates humans (based on repeated experience unfortunately), so it'd be nice to avoid having anything to do with them
