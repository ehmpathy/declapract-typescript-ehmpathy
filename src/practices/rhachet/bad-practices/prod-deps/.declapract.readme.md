# rhachet prod-deps bad practice

## what

detects `rhachet` and `rhachet-roles-*` packages listed as production dependencies and moves them to devDependencies.

## why

rhachet packages are build-time / development tooling only. they should never be shipped as production dependencies because:

1. **no runtime usage** — rhachet is used for agent role management, skill linking, and development workflows. none of this runs at runtime in production.

2. **bloated bundles** — including rhachet in prod deps unnecessarily inflates `node_modules` for deployed applications.

3. **dependency hygiene** — packages that are only used during development belong in `devDependencies`. at worst, if downstream packages need them, they should be declared as `peerDependencies`.

## packages covered

- `rhachet`
- `rhachet-roles-*` (e.g., `rhachet-roles-ehmpathy`, `rhachet-roles-bhrain`, `rhachet-roles-bhuild`)

## fix

moves all matching packages from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`, preserving their versions.

## correct placement

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "rhachet": "^1.19.0",
    "rhachet-roles-ehmpathy": "^1.15.0"
  }
}
```

or, if downstream packages need to use them:

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "rhachet": ">=1.0.0"
  }
}
```

never:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "rhachet": "^1.19.0"
  }
}
```
