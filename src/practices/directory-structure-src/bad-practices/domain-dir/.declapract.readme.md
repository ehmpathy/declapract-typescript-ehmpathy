the `src/domain/` directory pattern is deprecated

use `src/domain.objects/` instead for domain object declarations

this aligns with the directional-dependencies architecture where:
- `domain.objects/` contains canonical domain declarations
- `domain.objects/` must not depend on anything outside its own layer
- separates domain objects from domain operations for clearer boundaries
