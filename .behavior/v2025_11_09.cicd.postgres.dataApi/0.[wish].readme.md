readme should explain

1. that lambdas use rdsDataApi against livedb's in order to avoid needing to be within a VPC
   1. decreases startup times
   2. eliminates NAT requirement

2. the service will use rdsDataApi or jbdc api, based on whether hitting a livedb (remote) or a testdb (local)
   1. that way, connections against livedb can be acceptance tested too

3. that human:devs & robot:cicds use `use.${organization}.vpc.[prep|prod]` in order to open a bastion connection via ssh safely
