the `src/logic/` directory pattern is deprecated

use `src/domain.operations/` instead for domain behavior and business rules

this aligns with the directional-dependencies architecture where:
- `domain.operations/` contains domain behavior and business rules
- `domain.operations/` may depend on `domain.objects/` or `infra/`
- `domain.operations/` must not reference infrastructure concerns directly
