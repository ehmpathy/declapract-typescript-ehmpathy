layers in a project following directional-dependencies architecture:

```
src/
  contract/            # topmost — public interfaces, local commands
    api/               # public invocable api endpoints, deployed and exposed by the project
    cmd/               # private internal use entrypoints, supported by the project
    sdk/               # public software development kit exports, supported by the project
    cli/               # public command line interface contracts, supported by the project

  access/              # infrastructure layer (daos, sdks, svcs)
    daos/              # private persistence logic — may reference domain objects
    sdks/              # remote third party contracts, from any alt org
    svcs/              # remote first party contracts, from our own org

  domain.objects/      # canonical domain declarations
  domain.operations/   # domain behavior + business rules

  infra/               # infrastructure specific adapters
```

dependency rules:
- each layer may depend **only on the layers below it**
- `contract/` may depend on `domain.objects/` and `domain.operations/`
- `access/` may depend on `domain.objects/` and `domain.operations/`
- `domain.operations/` may depend on `domain.objects/` or `infra/`
- `domain.objects/` must not depend on anything outside its own layer
- `infra/` must not depend on anything outside its own layer

layer responsibilities:

- contract layer
  - summary: responsible for strictly exposing the logic/domain defined in the service
  - responsibilities:
    - specifies the inputs and outputs
    - normalizes inputs on behalf of user
    - validates the inputs
    - normalizes outputs on behalf of service
  - purpose:
    - separates how users interact with our business logic _from_ our business logic
  - supporting-references:
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/serverless-architectures-lambda/business-logic-outside-the-handler.html

- domain.objects layer
  - summary: defines the domain which this service masters
  - responsibilities:
    - specify domain objects
    - specify constants
  - purpose:
    - a canonical definition of the domain + ubiquitous language owned by the service

- domain.operations layer
  - summary: defines the business logic that this service manages
  - responsibilities:
    - define the business logic of the domain in an organized and maintainable way
  - purpose:
    - to explicitly define the business logic as close to human language as possible

- access layer
  - summary: defines how to persist data / leverage third party clients
  - responsibilities:
    - daos (data access objects)
    - sdks (third party remote service contracts)
    - svcs (first party remote service contracts)
  - purpose:
    - separates how to interact with data stores and remote services from our business logic

- infra layer
  - summary: defines infrastructure-specific adapters
  - responsibilities:
    - infrastructure adapters that bridge domain logic to specific infrastructure
  - purpose:
    - keeps infrastructure concerns isolated from domain logic
