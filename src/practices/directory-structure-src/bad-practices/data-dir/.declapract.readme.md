the `src/data/` directory pattern is deprecated

use `src/access/` instead, which contains:
- `daos/` - data access objects for persistence
- `sdks/` - third party remote service contracts
- `svcs/` - first party remote service contracts

this aligns with the directional-dependencies architecture where:
- `access/` may depend on `domain.objects/` and `domain.operations/`
- `access/` must remain free of domain knowledge and business rules
