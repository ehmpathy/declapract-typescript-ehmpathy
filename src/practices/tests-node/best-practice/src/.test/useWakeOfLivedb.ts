/**
 * .what = wake the shared aurora-serverless cluster before a suite runs, when this
 *         service reaches it — whether it OWNS the db or only invokes peers that do.
 * .why =
 *   - the non-prod cluster is aurora-serverless-v2 at min-capacity 0, so it auto-pauses
 *     when idle; the first downstream query after a pause cold-starts past the 90s test
 *     timeout and flakes the suite (svc-gateway hit this on mAddCrewMember + the quote suites)
 *   - a gateway/fan-out service owns NO db of its own, so a db-ownership signal misses it.
 *     the signal that it REACHES the shared cluster is a tunnel declared in its config —
 *     `config/prep.json`'s `database.tunnel`. that is the self-gate: a tunnel means a query
 *     lands on the cluster (direct or via a peer), so wake it; no tunnel means no-op.
 *   - `rhx use.rds.capacity` opens an ssm tunnel to the cluster and waits for it to accept
 *     connections, which resumes it for every consumer (incl. deployed lambdas), not just
 *     the local caller
 *   - best-effort: a warm db, absent tunnel alias, or absent skill must NEVER break the
 *     suite, so a wake failure is surfaced loud to stderr (not swallowed) and the suite
 *     proceeds — a wake is a latency nicety, not a correctness gate; the suite's own
 *     assertions are the gate
 *   - ci is skipped: creds arrive via oidc and the local ssm-tunnel path is unavailable there,
 *     so ci wakes via the dedicated `start:livedb:prep` workflow step instead
 * .note = this is the LIVEDB half of a suite's db needs — the shared prep cluster its peers query.
 *         it RESUMES a paused cluster. its pair, `useWakeOfTestdb`, is the LOCAL own-db half: it
 *         only PREFLIGHTS the local testdb (it cannot start it, so it fails loud with a `start:testdb`
 *         fix). the two form a symmetric pair; the name reads "wake" for symmetry, the act differs.
 *         the wake fires for prep OR test access, per define.invariant.test-and-prep-reach-prep-peers.
