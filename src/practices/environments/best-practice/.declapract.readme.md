# environments

a critical part of an application's environment is which stage it is running in

ehmpathy recognizes three standard stages in which applications run throughout their development cycle
- `prod` stage - a deployed production stack in which application that the business depends on run, affecting real customers
- `dev` stage - a deployed developer-only stack in which applications can run and interact with each other for testing
- `test` stage - an ephemeral, primarily local, developer-only stack in which developers run local code against for testing

this information is expected to be defined in the runtime environment through the following environmental variables
- `STAGE` env var - explicitly defines the stage
- `NODE_ENV` env var - implicitly defines the stage if `STAGE` was not explicitly defined
