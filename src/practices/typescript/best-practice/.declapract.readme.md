this bundle defines best practices for tsconfig

namely:
- build vs test config
- default name as test config, so that ide's automatically typecheck test files for you
  - otherwise, they exclude them, and you only find ts errors _after_ you run tsc - not while looking at file
- strict
  - strict mode on tsc prevents a _ton_ of errors
  - without it, `Type | null` -> `Type` -> so you have a bunch of bugs whenever a value could be null but you dont expect it to be / realize it could be
    - it defeats the point of typechecking, really
- absolute imports via @src/* path alias
  - eliminates fragile relative paths (../../..)
  - imports are stable regardless of file location
  - easier refactoring and code navigation
  - uses tsc-alias post-compilation to rewrite paths for node runtime
