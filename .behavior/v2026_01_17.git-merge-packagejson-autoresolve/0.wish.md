wish that we never saw a package.json git merge confict ever again

package.json merge conflicts should be easily eliminated

in cases where the same dependency was update in two branches, always pick the latest version from the two braches

in cases where a dependency was added in one but didn't exist in another, always union and keep it

in cases where a dependency was explicity removed from a branch but kept in another, always union the intent and remove it

we should be able to handle all of these cases deterministically

and i bet we're not the only folks who wanted this either

so lets ensure to research how others have done so via websearch
