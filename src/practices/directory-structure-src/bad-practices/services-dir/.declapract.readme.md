sometimes a "services" dir is used to describe the directory that business logic should reside in

this is kind of confusing, because typically in those same cases you are working in a project called `service-something`. so, "service-something" also has a directory of "services" inside of it... which is a little confusing

instead, we use the `logic` directory to store this code. its more clear, because this dir stores the business logic that this service was created to store (i.e., the whole point of the service is to give us the ability to run that logic).
