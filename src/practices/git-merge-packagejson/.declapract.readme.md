# git-merge-packagejson

## .what

this practice ensures projects use the `git-merge-packagejson` merge driver to auto-resolve package.json dependency version conflicts via semver rules.

## .why

merge conflicts in package.json are common when multiple developers update dependencies. this tool:

- picks the higher semver version when the same dependency is updated in both branches
- unions additions from both branches
- honors removal intent (removal wins over update)
- only resolves dependency sections (dependencies, devDependencies, peerDependencies, optionalDependencies)
- leaves non-dependency field conflicts with markers for human review

## .how

1. install the package as a dev dependency
2. configure .gitattributes to use the merge driver for package.json
3. run `npx git-merge-packagejson --install` to configure git

## .files

- `.gitattributes` - configures git to use the merge driver for package.json
- `package.json` - includes git-merge-packagejson as a dev dependency
