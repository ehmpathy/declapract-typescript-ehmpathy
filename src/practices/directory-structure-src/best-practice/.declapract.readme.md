  - summary: responsible for strictly exposing the logic/domain defined in the service
  - responsibilities:
    - specifies the inputs and outputs
    - normalizes inputs on behalf of user
    - validates the inputs
    - normalizes outputs on behalf of service
  - purpose:
    - separates how users interact with our business logic _from_ our business logic
  - supporting-references:
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/serverless-architectures-lambda/business-logic-outside-the-handler.html
- domain layer
  - summary: defines the domain which this service masters
  - responsibilities:
    - specify domain objects
    - specify constants
  - purpose:
    - a canonical definition of the domain + ubiquitous language owned by the service
- logic layer
  - summary: defines the business logic that this service manages
  - responsibilities:
    - define the business logic of the domain in an organized and maintainable way
  - purpose:
    - to explicitly define the business logic as close to human language as possible
- data layer:
  - summary: defines how to persist data / leverage third party clients
  - responsibilities:
    - daos
