# old-acceptance-dir-location

## .what

detects test files located in `acceptance/` or `accept.blackbox/` directories and migrates them to `blackbox/`.

## .why

the term "blackbox" makes the testing philosophy explicit:
- blackbox tests interact only through public contracts (APIs, CLIs, SDKs)
- no access to internal implementation details
- tests validate behavior from the caller's perspective

the rename from `acceptance/` or `accept.blackbox/` to `blackbox/` clarifies this intent and simplifies the naming.

## .fix

moves all files from `acceptance/` or `accept.blackbox/` to `blackbox/` while preserving the directory structure.

## .note

the `.acceptance.test.ts` file extension is preserved — it communicates the test type while the directory name communicates the testing philosophy.
