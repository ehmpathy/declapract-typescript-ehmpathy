wish =

instead of relative paths in src/*

we had absolute paths resolvable via `@src` -> `@gitroot/src`

so that paths had fixed imports independent of their relative paths

=>

easier maintenance and codewrites

---

by idea, we only need the `@src` alias

everything outside of `@src` can still use relative paths as needed for now

unless there's an easy way to allow the rest to say `@gitroot/...`

and `@src = @gitroot/src`
