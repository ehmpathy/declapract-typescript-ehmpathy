# old-acceptance-import-paths

## .what

detects import statements that reference the old `acceptance/` directory path.

## .why

the `acceptance/` directory has been renamed to `blackbox/` to make the testing philosophy explicit:
- blackbox tests interact only through public contracts
- no access to internal implementation details

import paths must be updated to reference `blackbox/` instead of `acceptance/`.

## .fix

replaces all occurrences of `acceptance/` with `blackbox/` in import paths.

## .examples

before:
```typescript
import { locally } from '../acceptance/environment';
import { stage } from '../../acceptance/utils/environment';
```

after:
```typescript
import { locally } from '../blackbox/environment';
import { stage } from '../../blackbox/utils/environment';
```
