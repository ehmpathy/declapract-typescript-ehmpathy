# Deprecated rhachet.use.ts File

This bad practice detects and removes the deprecated `@/rhachet.use.ts` (i.e., `rhachet.use.ts` at repo root) config file.

## Why

The `rhachet.use.ts` config file pattern has been deprecated. Projects should migrate away from this pattern.

## Fix

The fix automatically deletes the file from the repository.
