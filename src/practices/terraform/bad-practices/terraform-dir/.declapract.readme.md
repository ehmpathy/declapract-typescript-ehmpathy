having a `/provision/terraform` dir is bad practice since we use the tool terraform to provision multiple things:
- aws resources
- github resources
- etc

instead, those should be separately identified and managed with separate tf projects

we used to just manage aws-resources in each repo, so thats why this pattern originally existed
