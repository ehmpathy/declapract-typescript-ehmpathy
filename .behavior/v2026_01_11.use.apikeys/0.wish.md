wish =

1. use.apikeys.json is not created right now, when it does not exist. the best practice should fix that by creating it if
  it doesnt exist explicitly.

2. the .test.yml should be updated to use each of the keys specified in that use.apikeys.json

  as part of the best practice here src/practices/tests/best-practice

  it should read that json from the repo

  and then check+fix that .test.yml,

  e.g.,

    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:
        description: "api key for claude code cli, used in integration tests"
        required: false

  if  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is the only entry in that use.apikey.json


3.  check+fix that test.yml, publish.yml (if exists), and deploy.yml (if exists) atoo

e.g.,

jobs:
  suite:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/.test.yml
    with:
      creds-aws-region: us-east-1
      creds-aws-role-arn: ${{ vars.CREDS_CICD_AWS_DEV_OIDC_ROLE_ARN }} # use aws auth via oidc, if this repo supplies it
    secrets:
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}


for each key too


----

we should expect a full overwrite of the users content
    every time. the check function just needs to check whether
    what we would have written matches what already exists. so
    both the check and fix could leverage "expected" where
    "expected" = the template modified by the apikey
