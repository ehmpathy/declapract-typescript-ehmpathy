wish = that our github terraform provider did not depend on aws.s3 for remote state

src/practices/terraform-github/best-practice/provision/github/environment/main.tf

---

ideally, we could avoid state files all together and ask terraform to always source from the current state

however, with terraform's limitation, maybe there's a statefile solution that lives within a git repo already? (artifacts? etc?)
