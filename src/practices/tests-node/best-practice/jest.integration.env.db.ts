/**
 * .what = verify the local testdb is reachable, via a `SELECT 1` preflight, before a suite runs.
 * .why  = this preflight runs at jest-setup load, so its error is the first output a surfer reads
 *         when the testdb is unreachable. the prior form redirected psql's stderr to `/dev/null` and
 *         threw one hardcoded cause ("did you forget to start:testdb?"), so EVERY cause -- an absent
 *         psql binary, a bad password, an unapplied schema, a 3s timeout -- collapsed into a message
 *         that named only the likeliest and pointed away from the rest (a swallowed error). this
 *         surfaces psql's own words instead. it is split out of `jest.integration.env.ts` (a
 *         jest-setup module whose logic cannot be unit-tested in place) so the failure path is a pure
 *         fn with the `exec` boundary injected, and both the real-stderr path and the empty-stderr
 *         path are clamped + snapped.
 * .note = PGPASSWORD rides in `env`, never in the command args. node puts the failed command verbatim
 *         onto the thrown error's message, so a password passed as an arg would reach any log that
 *         prints that error. the args are an argv array (no shell), so a config value with shell
 *         metacharacters cannot be interpreted either (no injection).
 * .note = a failed preflight is CALLER-must-fix (a local testdb the human starts), so it throws a
 *         ConstraintError (exit 2) that NAMES the fix and PRESERVES psql's stderr on the chain -- a
 *         consumer can tell "not started" from "bad password" from "psql absent"
 *         (a caller-must-fix ConstraintError, exit 2).
