wish =

`acceptance/` dir -> `blackbox/` dir

for acceptance tests

to make it clearer that acceptance tests should be blackbox tests, against the external caller contracts

update the best practice to

1. move `acceptance/` -> `blackbox/`
2. eliminate any other references of the acceptance dir -> blackbox


we expect to see

`blackbox/*.acceptance.test.ts` files

going forward
