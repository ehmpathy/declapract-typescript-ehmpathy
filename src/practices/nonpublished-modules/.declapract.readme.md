nonpublished modules are used when we are testing out some new functionality and have not yet generalized it sufficiently to warrant creating a npm module of its own yet (e.g., follow W.E.T and have not written it twice already)

however, when modules do graduate and get published, we want to make sure we start using them and stop using the "nonpublished" one

this practice consists of bad-practice checks that make sure whenever we publish one (or deprecate one) we dont keep using the old one
