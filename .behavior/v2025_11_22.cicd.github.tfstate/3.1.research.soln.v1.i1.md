### 5. Stateless & Drift Detection Approaches

**Description**: Minimize or eliminate traditional state file dependency through import and drift detection.

#### Concepts:

**5.1 Drift Detection Strategy**
- **Approach**: Regularly detect and reconcile infrastructure drift instead of relying solely on state
- **Tools & Methods**:
  - `terraform plan -refresh-only`: Inspect state changes without automatic overwrite
  - `terraform plan -detailed-exitcode`: Returns exit codes (0=no changes, 1=errors, 2=drift detected)
  - Driftctl: Open-source tool comparing real-world state with Terraform state
  - HCP Terraform Standard Edition: Built-in drift detection
- **Limitations**:
  - Terraform is inherently stateful (unlike Azure Bicep, GCP CDM, AWS CDK which are stateless)
  - "Computed" optional attributes not properly covered by drift detection
  - Cannot fully eliminate state file
- **Review**: Complementary strategy, not a complete replacement for state management
- **Citations**:
  - [Manage Resource Drift - HashiCorp Tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/resource-drift)
  - [Terraform Drift Detection Guide - Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/blog/terraform-drift-detection)
  - [Detecting and Managing Drift - HashiCorp Blog](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/detecting-and-managing-drift-with-terraform)
  - [Terraform Drift Detection Guide - Firefly](https://www.firefly.ai/academy/terraform-drift-detection-guide)
  - [Ultimate Guide for Drift Detection - Terramate](https://terramate.io/rethinking-iac/the-ultimate-guide-for-terraform-and-opentofu-drift-detection-and-remediation/)

**5.2 Import-Based Workflow**
- **Approach**: Use `terraform import` to rebuild state from existing infrastructure
- **Methods**:
  - `terraform import` command (traditional)
  - Import blocks (Terraform 1.5+)
  - `terraform plan -refresh-only` and import for reconciliation
- **Use Case**: Recovery scenarios, migrating unmanaged infrastructure
- **Review**: Useful for state reconstruction but not a replacement for ongoing state management
- **Citation**: [Manage Resource Drift - HashiCorp Tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/resource-drift)

**5.3 Truly Stateless Alternative: Use Different IaC Tool**
- **Concept**: Switch to stateless IaC tools
- **Options**:
  - Azure Bicep (stateless)
  - GCP Cloud Deployment Manager (stateless)
  - AWS Cloud Development Kit (stateless)
- **Review**: Only true stateless option, but requires complete tool change and only works for single cloud provider
- **Citation**: [Terraform Drift: a Comprehensive Guide - Scalr](https://scalr.com/learning-center/terraform-drift-a-comprehensive-guide/)

**Pros**:
- Reduced dependence on state file integrity
- Can recover from state loss
- Drift detection provides infrastructure validation

**Cons**:
- Terraform is fundamentally stateful
- Cannot completely eliminate state files
- Drift detection has limitations (computed attributes)
- Switching tools requires significant refactoring

## Conclusion

For eliminating AWS S3 dependency while maintaining GitHub workflows, **HCP Terraform Cloud's free tier** offers the most practical, production-ready solution with zero infrastructure requirements and excellent GitHub integration.

If avoiding any external service is a hard requirement, **terraform-backend-git** provides an experimental git-native approach, though it requires accepting trade-offs in maturity and requires deploying a custom HTTP backend server.

The ideal "stateless" workflow referenced in the wish (avoiding state files entirely) is not achievable with Terraform's current architecture, as Terraform is fundamentally stateful by design. Alternative IaC tools like Azure Bicep or AWS CDK are stateless but would require abandoning Terraform entirely.
