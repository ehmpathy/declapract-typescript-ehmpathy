a previous, now deprecated, best practice was to have the extension of `*.test.integration.ts` or `*.test.acceptance.ts` on test files

we've since moved over to `*.integration.test.ts` and `*.acceptance.test.ts` (it having the `.test.ts` extension still makes tools that dont expect different test types work with these test files out of the box, which is a nice to have)
