conventional commits:
- standardize how commits look
- make commits scannable (i.e., what was the purpose of this change? feature? fix? just docs or ci?)
- make changelogs autobuildable (i.e., releases now say what was changed, ignoring the parts that dont matter)
- make releases easy to define (i.e., release versions are defined based on contents of commits)
