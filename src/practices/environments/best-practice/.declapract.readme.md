we have 3 environments for our code:
- production (`stage=prod`)
  - purpose: deployed software that the business relies on
  - details:
    - deployed software that user can interact with
    - interacts with prod databases which stores real business-critical data
    - clients hit other production services
    - in the "prod" aws account
- development (`stage=dev`)
  - purpose: deployed software that developers can use for testing
  - details:
    - deployed software that users can not interact with, only developers, tests, and other dev services
    - interacts with dev databases which store primarily test data
    - clients hit other dev services
    - in the "dev" aws account
- test (`stage=test`)
  - purpose: local software that developers can use for testing
  - details:
    - local software that only developers/cicd can access from local machines that checked out the code
    - interacts directly with local databases, spun up in docker instances; interacts through clients with dev database
    - clients hit dev services
    - in the "dev" aws account
