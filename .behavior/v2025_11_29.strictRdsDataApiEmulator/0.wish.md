wish = we have a local RDS Data API emulator that is as strict as the real AWS RDS Data API

--

problem:
- the current `koxudaxi/local-data-api` emulator uses JDBC under the hood
- JDBC automatically infers parameter types (e.g., UUID from string format)
- the real AWS RDS Data API does NOT infer types - it requires explicit `typeHint`
- this means tests pass locally but fail against real AWS (e.g., `uuid = text` operator error)

goal:
- local emulator should fail the same way real AWS does when `typeHint` is missing
- catch type issues in integration tests before hitting AWS
- maintain parity between local and production behavior
