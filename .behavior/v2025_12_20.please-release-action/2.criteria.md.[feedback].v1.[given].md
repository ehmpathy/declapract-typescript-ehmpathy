> the critical paths are too granular right now; instead of having a combination of [commit x semver]
  listed in critical paths, just create two broader scope sections that decompose the individual behavior
  and reference one in the other; e.g., # scope.1 = compute next semver (scope1.usecase1 = one fix:,
  scope1.usecase2 = one feat:, scope1.usecase3 = one break:, etc); also, use the syntax `given(...),
  when(...), then(...)`; dont forget the parens
